# MM_2017
My implementation of various machine learning methods to predict the outcomes of the 2017 March Madness games

## Data Sources
All data comes from Kaggle's yearly March Madness Competition

The data for 2017 can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2017/data

## Dependencies

* Python 2.7
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn

## Features used
I didn't get a chance to really create many features for this data set due to a time crunch to finish before the tournament started. The features I used were:

* Offensive Quotient
* Defensive Quotient
* ELO Rating
